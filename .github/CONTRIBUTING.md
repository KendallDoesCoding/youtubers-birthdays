# Adding a YouTube Channel

If you are adding a YouTube Channel to the list, the channel must classify under the following

- At least 100K subscribers on YouTube (except for some exceptions, at the discretion of KendallDoesCoding).
- Uploaded a video or live-streamed to YouTube within the last 1 MONTH.
- The channel should be an individual and not a COMPANY (for eg: you cannot add Good Mythical Morning, or T-Series, as they are companies and not individuals).
- The channel should not be controversial (certain exceptions can be made, up to the judgement of @KendallDoesCoding).
- Birthday Format must be as follows: D/M, YY (eg: 2 May, 2000)
  **- The final decision on whether the channel gets added or not, is up to the discretion of KendallDoesCoding. **

2. - Now, after adding the youtuber's info on the website, you have to update the README (Important as only it will mark as an original contribution on GitHub)
   - For this fork the repo and update README to add youtuber info.
   - **Note: even if on the website the newly added youtuber shows at the last, if the catergory was already added before (eg. Gaming) add the newly added YouTuber  add the end of that catergory and not at the end of the table.**
